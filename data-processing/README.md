Battery Management System Data Processing
-----------------------------------------

Provides a GUI for analysing data text files generated by the BMS and also by
the BMS GUI. These are csv records consisting of an ID and several fields of
associated data.

The program scans the file for start and end time, and extracts a list of
record types. The user can then request a number of performance measures over
a specified time interval:

- average currents to allow analysis of energy budget.
- extracted measures with average, peak or sample within a subinterval, to a csv
  file for plotting.
