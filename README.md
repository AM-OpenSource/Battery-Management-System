Battery Management System GUI
-----------------------------

The GUI provides a means of displaying performance and status information in
numerical and graphical form, setting up data recording on the remote system
and configuring the system.

It can connect via serial (directly or using a serial to USB adapter), or by
TCP/IP when connected through an intermediate machine that maps the serial
interface to a TCP/IP interface. This makes it possible to monitor the system
remotely over Internet.
